        title: "Searching for the first sound",
        content: "First time, it’s always very unhandled, you don’t know what is coming and whether what you expect will happen like that or not. My first time trying out a violin happened very awkwardly and vulnerably. I’ve listened to many violinists playing but I did not expect that it’s this at the beginning. I opened the box and was so eager to tighten the strings to quickly get to hear the first sound but it turned out that there was no sound, I was waiting and waiting but nothing happened. Reacts of my family members were like “so it’s not working? you should not have bought this cheap violin”. It kinda hurts. I just wanted to start small and judgement just does not help to encourage me here. I then locked myself into my room to fix the strings, to rosin the bow, to search it up online to see if anyone has faced the same situation. I am so new to this instrument and it’s also very new, everything is new and of course I am not good, so when others expect things to be good, you have nothing other than pressure, all the joy and eagerness just go away immediately if you don’t know to control your emotion well. I just don’t like that just because it’s cheap, people think it’s not good, that’s biased. It reminds me of the first time I coded, it felt really intimidating and insecure. Doubts and judgements are definitely dream killers and expectation is usually a chemistry for these. Doing something with no or low expectation usually yields better results because we can just do it, all we can. When we have doubt, our energy is already being cut from full, like we do it but afraid to fail so failure is even more likely to happen. In this case of trying a violin, one I was not even sure whether I am actually into it just through listening, two I am not a professional so I don’t need a good violin right now, starting small is good, I can upgrade if I want later. Probably I am taking it too serious because people are evaluating whether it’s good and their opinion of having a good enough one even just to try. Good or not does not matter to me since I need to learn to play with it first, my curiosity is not going to be eroded just because the sound is not coming out nice, isn’t it?",

        title: "Cake Baking",
        content: "Baking cake is interesting, you prepare all things needed then put into the oven and wait for the outcome with full of hope that it will look somewhere close to your imagination. It’s like trying your best and see what will come out, very uncertain but exciting journey. Yes, the journey, result is most important but the journey matters even more. Remember all the hard work of beating eggs and mixing powder. Especially, every step you take has to be precise otherwise you might ruin your cake. Which one should come first and what is the exact amount of each, these can’t be taken for granted. Sounds like all or nothing but true. No one will touch your cake if it does not taste good. I can imagine a similar but more serious idea for making a baby, you better well prepare in terms of physical, mental and financial aspects. Prepare as much as you can and put as much of effort you have then leave the rest to the universe.\n\n"
        + "It has the journey of preparing and the journey of waiting for the outcome. The former one takes effort and the later takes patience and calm because thoughts will come to you such as “what if I did something wrong”, “was that step or action in the original recipe or not?”, “that recipe-breaking move, not sure how it will affect the cake”. Of course, when you reflect on it, you feel like you could have done better in some steps but no way you can make any change other than taking a lesson for next times. Words can’t describe your anxiety but every cake is more like an experiment and practice makes better.\n\n",

        content: "Dear mom and dad, I am so grateful for all of your hard work and sacrifices for me to do what I want. I wish you were here to share with me this thrilling moment when I graduate from my Master degree in Science in Management, Concentration in Entrepreneurial Leadership in which students are trained everything to start a venture."
        + "Dear friends and family, thank you so much for always supporting me (even from far away) to make this journey accomplished."
        + "Time flies so fast, it’s almost 1 year since I left to move to the U.S. At this time last year, I was in a tough consideration whether I should go and whether it’s worth it. It was one of my toughest decisions I have ever made and one of the biggest risks I have ever taken. However, today, I am confident to confirm that it’s a good risk to take, that this decision brought me to meet so many great people, that this led me to amazing experiences, that this got me to learn more about myself and what I really want to do. Whenever I introduce to others that I am studying Entrepreneurship, they usually react: “Interesting! Can you really study it?” and Yes, it’s very interesting and there’s a lot to learn to be a good entrepreneur. Entrepreneurship has been a humbling yet exciting and meaningful experience. It’s humbling since we need to get out there and listen to people and we get to try, to fail, to learn and try again. It’s exciting and meaningful because we always get to do what we want or at least what we really care and more importantly, to create or add more economical and social values. Every entrepreneur is so unique in his passion, his characteristics and his view to the world. Thank you, Babson, for bringing me opportunities, for always letting me be myself (although most of the time, I am a bit weird^^), and for getting me to do lots of experiments and learn from them. My experiences this year have proven these following lessons:"
        + " 1. You can only plan 10% of everything in your life, so don’t plan too much."
        + " 2. Understand what you really want to do is hard, but keep looking for it because it’s really important."
        + " 3. Fall in love with problems, always observe people and things around you because opportunities are there to make things better."
        + " 4. Be human, otherwise, you are not capable to work with another human."
        + " 5. Whatever you do, choose to be happy and lead your life!"
        + " 6. Passion, it’s something you cannot lie about or fake."
        + " 7. The biggest barrier to do something is to START. So just start, just do it! You never know until you do it."
        + " 8. People, people, people! Working with people is hard but you can never be successful without knowing how to work with people. And yet there are perfect people to work with, you get to motivate with a good WHY (and sometimes HOW) for them to do the work."
        + " 9. If entrepreneurship were a drug, I would be an addict."
        + " 10. Failure is not bad, it should be your ‘companion’ that teaches you many valuable lessons, don’t be afraid to fail."
        + " 11. Rejection is good, take it and crunch it."
        + " 12. If you enjoy doing something, most likely you will do it very well."
        + " 13. It takes practice to be better and reach greatness."
        + " 14. When you are most angry about something, it’s when your value is speaking."
        + " 15. The more risks you take, the more opportunities you get, so don’t hesitate to take risks (with some calculation^^)"
        + " 16. It matters what you do but sometimes it matters more how you present or communicate it to other people, basically how to let the world know what you are doing in the easiest way!"
        + " 17. You = average of 5 people usually around you (this is popular but very true)"
        + " 18. Always bring value to the table, that’s how people value to be with you."
        + " 19. Relationships, they may start naturally but take effort to build."
        + " 20. Always appreciate and find joy in everything you do, that’s how you enjoy moments."
        + " 21. Confidence is the most beautiful dress and the best vitamin to get you to do something."
        + " 22. Live healthy, sleep well, be mindful otherwise do not even bother being successful."
        + " 23. “Don’t be boring. Have fun. Understand what makes you happy and what speaks to your heat. Do the right thing. Try new things even if you are old. Don’t worry about being cool, be warm. Care about what is going on in different parts of the world and what you can do to make the world a little better.” — Akio Toyota, speaking at Babson Graduation Commencement 2019."
        + " This year I have been a TAKER who receives tons of support and from now on it is time for me to be more a DOER and GIVER. I am ready and excited to go to the world. No more projects, pitches, and assignments at school; no more Olin with a very inclusive and diverse community, no more; not many friends around (in person), only real-life challenges, here I go, ready to start!",
